# AWAR
WAR refers to the commonly used baseball statistic, wins above replacement which attempts to measure a player's value relative to a hypothetical minor league replacement.
For the uninitiated, this article is a good introduction: https://library.fangraphs.com/misc/war/, as is this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipD053CE3PI&t=567s.
The purpose of this project is twofold. Its first purpose is to help me develop my comfort working with numpy to (hopefully) efficiently manipulate large datasets.
Its second purpose is to adress issues I have with the methods publications like baseball reference and fangraphs use to calculate war, particularly as it pertains to 
assessing the values of stolen bases.
